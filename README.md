# CIFAR10-CNN

This is a coursework undertaken for the module Advanced Artificial Intelligence.

It is written in python and utilizes the TensorFlow and Keras libraries.

The goal was to learn and understand on how to build Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using the Keras library.
Focus was given in the accuracy of the network but also to the loss function. Different aspects of the CNN was researched in order to reach a more comprehensive idea on what influences the learning of the network.

The observations can be seen later on in this file.

The base architecture used was the LeNet5 implementation.

The code can be found [here](/Code/CIFAR10-CNN.ipynb).
